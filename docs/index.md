# Alleviate Children's Health Issues through Games and Machine Learning

This interactive book is a summary of my thesis research project carried out at completion of my Undergraduate Degree in Electronic Engineering at the University of Southampton. 

A summary of this work is available as an article published for [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/disability-diagnostic-using-eeg-time-series-analysis-8035300837ac) and part of the code is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pierpaolo28/Alleviate-Children-s-Health-Issues-through-Games-and-Machine-Learning).

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Koushik Maharatna, for giving me the
opportunity to do this project. This experience enabled me broaden my knowledge
on a variety of topics and skills which will play a crucial role in my upcoming career.

I would additionally like to thank, Rafael Gutierrez Nuno and Noura Alotaibi for
having introduced me to the Enobio 20 EEG Cap system and to the data-set used
throughout this project.

Finally, I express my gratitude to my second examiner, Professor Martin Charlton,
for his support throughout the project.
